*Notes **from** myself*

> I started program this application the ***25/04/2023*** with objective of upgrade my skills in **web design, backend, PHP, HTML/CSS and databases**. In one word, to ***progress***, where does the name of the application come from. By the way, I already tried to make a project like this, but with **too big ambitious**, in consequences: **I gave up**. I made a lot of **mistakes** that I will write in the **"notes to myself"** section, if it interest you.

*Notes **to** myself*
